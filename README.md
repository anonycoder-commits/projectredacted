# Project REDACTED - Horror Mod for Minecraft

## Overview
Project REDACTED is an immersive horror mod that creates a psychological horror experience within Minecraft. It introduces mysterious entities, subtle disturbances, and increasingly disturbing events that follow the player as they progress through the game.

## Features for YouTube Showcases

### Horror Entities
- **Iteration**: A mysterious entity that stalks players, teleports when not being observed, and creates visual/audio distortions
- **Protocol_37**: An enigmatic creature that follows players at a distance and creates unsettling effects
- **Various other horror entities**: Each with unique behaviors and atmospheric effects

### Progressive Horror System
The horror intensifies over time through several stages:
1. **Subtle Stage**: Minor disturbances and sounds
2. **Disturbance Stage**: More noticeable events and occasional entity sightings
3. **Obvious Stage**: Direct encounters with horror entities
4. **Meta Stage**: Fourth wall breaking effects (screen glitches, UI disturbances)
5. **Final Stage**: Full-scale horror experience

### Atmospheric Effects
- **Sound Design**: Whispers, heartbeats, growls, screams, and ambient sounds
- **Visual Distortions**: Screen static, corruption effects, color inversions
- **Sleep Prevention**: Horror entities prevent rest, displaying cryptic messages
